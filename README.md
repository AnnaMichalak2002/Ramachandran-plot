# Ramachandran-plot
# Overview
This Python code calculates phi and psi angles for individual amino acid residues in proteins and presents them on a graph.
# Requirements
The program works on Linux but not on Windows, so try Windows Subsystem for Linux, virtual machine or docker
# Usage
```bash
python script.py <pdb_file_path>
```
Replace <pdb_file_path> with the path to the PDB file you want to analyze.

# Output
File named ramachandran_plot.pdf that visualized the distribution of angles φ (phi) and ψ (psi) for individual amino acid residues in proteins.
